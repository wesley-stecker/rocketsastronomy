        The world is a complicated place with many things working in it. Itâ€™s hard to grasp it all at once. To get a sense of the world we live in we need to look up to the stars. Though looking though, a telescope of the cosmos, to launching a model rocket both are cool and thought provoking.
        It is my goal to share all I know about Astronomy and Rocketry to help others to find the enjoyment and perspective it gives me. Now the question is what do you want to learn about?

      <h3>Astronomy</h3>
      <p>
        Astronomy is the study of the stars. Astronomy can be done with the largest of telescopes to the naked eye, you just need to know where to look. The tools that any astronomer needs is a good way to track the stars. I would recommend any good star gazing application on your smart phone to figure out what you are looking at in the sky. I use Sky safari 7 Pro but that one is a paid app so all most any free one will do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best things to look at without a telescope are constellations like Ursa major and Ursa minor (Big and Little dipper) or the Orian constellation. You can look can see Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Mars and the Moon. All planets in the sky follow the same line path because all the orbits of the planets are almost flat. The closer a planet is to the sun (Mercury, Venus and mars) the closer to sunrise of sunset you will have to wait and see them.

      <h3>Rocketry</h3>
      <p>
        Rocketry is very interesting to learn about. From learning how the United Space got to the moon, Astrodynamics for orbiting spacecraft, and making your own model rocket and seeing how high you can go.
