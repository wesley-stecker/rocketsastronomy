                    <h3>How rockets work? How Orbits Work?</h3>
                    <p>Getting a rocket into orbit involves overcoming Earth's gravitational pull and achieving a high enough velocity to stay in a stable path around the planet. Here’s a step-by-step overview of the process:</p>
                    <h3>1. Launch</h3>
                    <p>Vertical Ascent: The rocket launches vertically to clear the dense lower atmosphere quickly, minimizing atmospheric drag.</p>
                    <p>Gravity Turn: After reaching a certain altitude, the rocket gradually tilts its trajectory to a more horizontal path in a maneuver called a gravity turn. This helps to start building horizontal velocity necessary for orbit.</p>
                    <h3>2. Stage Separation</h3>
                    <p>Rockets typically have multiple stages, each with its own engines and fuel. After the first stage exhausts its fuel, it is jettisoned to reduce weight, allowing the next stage to ignite and continue the journey.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section1text1">
                    <h3>3. Building Horizontal Velocity</h3>
                    <p>To achieve orbit, the rocket must build up enough horizontal speed. This speed depends on the desired orbit but typically ranges around 7.8 kilometers per second (28,000 kilometers per hour) for low Earth orbit (LEO).</p>
                    <h3>4. Achieving Orbital Insertion</h3>
                    <p>Once the rocket reaches the necessary altitude and velocity, it shuts off its engines and coasts along its orbital path. The precise timing and orientation are crucial to ensure the rocket enters a stable orbit rather than falling back to Earth or escaping into space.</p>
                    <h3>5. Circularization</h3>
                    <p>Often, the initial orbit is elliptical. A final engine burn, called a circularization burn, adjusts the orbit to make it more circular. This typically occurs at the highest point of the initial elliptical orbit (apogee).</p>

                    <h3>History of exploration</h3>
                    <h3>Early Concepts and Developments</h3>
                    <p>Early 20th Century: Theoretical foundations were laid by pioneers like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, and Hermann Oberth, who proposed ideas for rockets and space travel.</p>
                    <h3>The Space Race</h3>
                    <p>1957: The Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, marking the beginning of the space age.</p>
                    <p>1961: Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space aboard Vostok 1.</p>
                    <p>1969: The United States' Apollo program successfully landed the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface.</p>

                    <h3>Post-Moon Landing Era</h3>
                    <p>1970s</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union launched a series of Salyut space stations.</p>
                    <p>The US launched the Skylab space station.</p>
                    <p>Voyager 1 and 2 missions were launched to explore the outer planets and are still sending data from interstellar space.</p>
                    <p>1981: The first Space Shuttle, Columbia, launched, initiating a new era of reusable spacecraft.</p>
                    <h3>International Collaboration</h3>
                    <p>1990s</p>
                    <p>The Hubble Space Telescope was launched, providing unprecedented views of the universe.</p>
                    <p>The US and Russia cooperated on the Mir space station missions.</p>
                    <p>International Space Station (ISS) construction began, involving collaboration among NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA.</p>
